# ðŸ”¹ Light-Sensitive LED with Photocell Sensor

Because why settle for basic LEDs when you can make them react to ambient light like it's 2099? This setup uses a photocell sensor to control LED brightness based on the surrounding light. Mood lighting, but make it Arduino.

## Technologies Utilized:

- Arduino (C/C++)
- Photocell Light Sensor
- LED
- Resistors & Basic Electronics
